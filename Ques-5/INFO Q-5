I have used python to write this script.
There are several libraries used in this script so comments are available which will be helping in understand the code.
I have used google and little gpt for gaining knowledge about requests and smtp server working and libraries use.
This code checks for deadline only once a day but it can be setup such that it checks every specific tine but to just reduce the number of requests and server load I have set it once.
In the script we have to provide userid,password for lms account as well as sender's email and receiver's email.
Using datetime and time module I have checked if time will be less than or equal to 6 hours then it will send remainder otherwise it will went on sleep till the time matches.
