* After downloading ova file and virtualbox I imported ova file into virtualbox and machine boots.
* Then I logged in as Guest User into Ubuntu machine.
* I tried easy passwd for root user access like root,admin,ubuntu,kali etc. but I know that I will failed and obviously no doubt I did.
* Then after I run the command <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ip addr </span command in terminal then I got the ip address and I search through open http port 80 <br> I got this info from nmap I found a page about Xenia which is mascot for linux.
* Also I am not able to see any page or login that I have to crack ..
